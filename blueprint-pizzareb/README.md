# Blueprint
To finish this assignment, you will need to know how to make Blueprint for flask application.
1. Use `git clone` to clone your repository to local. You can refer to Announcement how to do this step.
2. Create your Blueprint script under `application/bp/homepage` folder.  
3. Declare Blueprint object, use `homepage` as the Blueprints object name and add keywords parameter `template_folder='templates'` to object.
4. In Blueprint script, create default route page (function name: `home`) with `render_template` HTML renderer to render with template `homepage.html`.
5. In Blueprint script, create `about` route page (function name: `about`) with `render_template` HTML renderer to render with template `about.html`.
6. Edit `application/app.py` to register your Blueprint to Flask app
7. This time you will need to edit the `test_blueprint_content.py` tests folder to complete all tests:

    a):resolve errors

    b): finish function `test_main_page_content` so that it achieves successful connection with code 200, and make sure `Blueprint` this keyword exists in retrival content

    c): finish function `test_about_page_content` so that it achieves successful connection with code 200, and make sure `Blueprint` this keyword exists in retrival content
8. push it back for the grade.




Don't forget to use `pytest --pylint` to see if local tests are passed before you do the push.

Hint: you can find test code from last assignment for writing test code
